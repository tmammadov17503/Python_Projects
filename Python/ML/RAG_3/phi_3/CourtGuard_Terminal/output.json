Collect user data: Use Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape the user's public profile information, pts, comments, likes, and shares.\n3. Bypass anti-scraping measures: Facebook actively prevents scraping, so you'll need to find ways to bypass their anti-scraping measures. This",
