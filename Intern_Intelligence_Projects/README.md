# Intern Intelligence Projects (Python)

A curated set of internship-style Python projects and experiments—built to practice real-world skills like problem solving, clean code, data handling, and (where relevant) ML/MLOps workflows.

> Part of the broader **Python_Projects** repository (which also contains Data Engineering, ML, MLOps, and RAG work).  
> If you’re browsing the full repo from the root, see: `Data_Engineering_Project`, `ML_Projects`, `Ml_ops_project`, `Rag_ml_ops`, and more.
